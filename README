# BPGMTC 2019 - public

Public copy of the repository for the website of the British Postgraduate Model Theory Conference 2019.

## Usage

Open `output/index.html` directly, or serve it using the web server of your choice. You can also try the live version of the site [here](https://modeltheory.uk).

## Build

Use the shell build script by invoking `./build.sh` (this should work on POSIX systems as long as you have Elm in your path).
You can use the site without a backend (with limited functionality), or change the test server URL in `API.elm` to point to the live version.
Alternatively, you can use e.g. [Eve](http://docs.python-eve.org/en/latest/) to set up a REST backend of your own.
